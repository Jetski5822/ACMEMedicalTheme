## Site Areas ##

Within any site you might want to style you site differently depending on the area, this is difficult if the page has no taxonomy telling you what it is, and you dont want to rely on the url. I have added a Site Area taxonomy with the ability to style by area.

The out of box terms are :

- Default
- Provider
- Nurse
- Member
- Partner

you can use sitearea layer rules too to say, sitearea('nurse')
